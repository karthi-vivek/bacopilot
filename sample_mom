# **Meeting Minutes**

## **1. Objectives Discussed**

* Discuss the BRP 13 scope for the AI POD.
* Confirm that DeepL and Harvey products are in scope for this POD.
* Review the roadmap for the BRP scope.
* Identify high-level items planned for this BRP.

## **2. Business Problems Identified**

* Need for dedicated focus on L3 support since both products are already in production.
* Need to understand vendor capabilities for handling confidential data in Harvey.

## **3. Functional Requirements**

* DeepL:

  * User training and handling.
  * Best-practice guidance for using the DeepL translation tool for PPTs and unclassified documents.
* Harvey:

  * Define rules for data segregation.
  * Review vendor product workspace features to determine support for data segregation.
  * Complete POC for Word Add-in to decide whether a custom wrapper add-in is required.
  * Establish baseline CSAT ratings for Harvey.

## **4. Non-Functional Requirements**

* No explicit non-functional requirements stated in the provided text.

## **5. Data Requirements**

* Understanding data segregation needs as we move toward confidential data usage in Harvey.

## **6. Process Changes / Workflow Impacts**

* L3 support will be a dedicated block for the full BRP, and all effort related to L3 will be tracked explicitly.

## **7. Risks / Issues Raised**

* Uncertainty around whether Harvey’s vendor workspace features adequately support data segregation.
* Pending decision on whether a custom wrapper add-in is needed for Word (dependent on POC outcome).

## **8. Dependencies Mentioned**

* Dependency on vendor feature review for Harvey workspace data segregation.
* Dependency on completion and results of the Word Add-in POC.
* Dependency on user inputs to establish CSAT baseline.

## **9. Decisions Taken**

* No explicit decisions were stated in the text.

## **10. Open Questions / Items Requiring Clarification**

* Whether Harvey’s workspace features will fully support required data segregation.
* Whether the custom wrapper add-in will be needed.
* What the CSAT baseline will look like (pending user feedback).

## **11. Next Steps**

* Conduct user training and define DeepL best-practice guidance.
* Review Harvey vendor features to define data segregation rules.
* Complete the Harvey Word Add-in POC.
* Engage users to collect baseline CSAT data.
* Set up structure and tracking for dedicated L3 support for the full BRP.
